What is indentation error? Why indentation is important? Give one simple example?\n","\n","\n","##Ans:\n","- identation error is error occur when we forget to give proper space, tab at the time when we define the function or any kind of block of code.\n","-identation helps in readibility of the code, usually python interpretor does not know about excution sequence of the code. identation helps the code to execute line by line.\n","\n","##following example gives me the error\n","  ```python\n","if 4>2:\n","print(yes)\n","else:\n","print(no)\n","```\n","```python\n","IndentationError: expected an indented block\n","```\n","##But the following give me right output:\n"," ```python\n","if 4>2:\n","  print(\"yes\")\n","else:\n","  print(\"no\")\n","```\n","\n","##output:-\n","```python\n","yes\n","```\n","\n","2.
